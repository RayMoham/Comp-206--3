  Documentataion for Assignment 3 - Q1
 
 Program Name: Whitespace Counter

 Program Purpose:
   Demonstrates a user file method based code which counts the whitespaces of the given user file.
   It utilizes stream identities and I/O objects for coding and printing.
  
 Compile: (assuming MinGW-W64  is running): g++ -o Assignment3Question1 Assignment3Question1.cpp
 Execution (assuming MinGW-W64 is running): .\Assignment3Question1
 
 Notes: Main must return type int
 
 Classes:  - No classes 

 Variables:
 linespace: string variable which transfers the read content into value 
 excerptfile: holds the file and opens this string using ifstream
 value: holds read content of file and extracts it into wordval
 count: measures the count of whitespaces
 counterfunc: used in main to print whitespaces using the argument and function
 whitespacecount: function holding the string file as argument
	
*/

/*
 Test plan layout.

 Normal case: (Asking for excerpt.txt as requested by question )	
 Enter name of File you would like to input: excerpt.txt
 The number of white spaces are: 342
 -terminates
 
 Bad Data case 1 (numerical input (large numbers))
Enter name of File you would like to input: 443322
Error : Can't Open File
The number of white spaces are: -2
 -terminates 

 Bad Data case 2 (a random txt input made )
 Enter name of File you would like to input: dsv.txt
Error : Can't Open File
The number of white spaces are: -2
-terminates
 
 Bad Data case 3 (Non -alpha input check)
Enter name of File you would like to input: 6y4#$%j'
Error : Can't Open File
The number of white spaces are: -2
-terminates

 Discussion:
 	This program uses File I/O methods and steam functions to operate. A function is used to accept a string which holds the file.
 	The file is then read and transferred and conditioned by a series of while loops and counter to check for whitespaces.
 	The display is a simple call in main which asks user for input file name to read and proceeds to display the number of whitespaces.
